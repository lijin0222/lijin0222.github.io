<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at the Lyles School of Civil and Construction Engineering at Purdue University. I am also closely collaborating with the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) on JTRP projects.

I earned both my PhD and Bachelor's degrees in Transportation Engineering from Tongji University in Shanghai, China, graduating with honor and the highest GPA in my cohort.

My research interest includes pavement sustainability, asset management, material informatics, and transportation electrification. I have published more than 25 papers as the first/corresponding author at the top international journals with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7axMkuEAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>964</span></strong></a>.
